# TurtleHouse
A basic house in Turtle Graphics and python.
# How to install
You need to install the latest version of Python (3.7 as of writing) and make sure you have Turtle Graphics included (this should be by default).
# What it does
It makes a house. Simple as that. A roof with a round window and ground floor has a basic door and window. Can be modified to have more.
